A17 129 911 May 2, 1967 Mr. Max Carl 7069 Delmar Blvd. University City, Mo. Dear Sir: We wish to advise that we have checked arrival records for both New York City and by way of Canada, and we have been unable to find the record of your entry into the United States. We are wondering if you have obtained any document which would establish your presence in the United States before June 29, 1906. Very truly yours, PRIMUS F. MAJDA Officer inCharge
