55894/502 April 12, 1935. APR 16 1935 District Director, Los Angeles. Reference is had to your file 9097/6363, 8097/4240, appli- cation for a warrant of arrest of the alien, PHILIP MICHAEL PAPS, a native of the Philippine Islands, subject of Great Britian, Greek race, who entered the United States at New Orleans, Louisiana, on November 5, 1928, as a member of the crew of the SS "Dryden". It appears that this alien arrived in this country under cir- cumstances which warranted belief that he was not amenable to the immigration laws, and that he was entitled to the exemption of- forded other natives of Philippine Islands at that time. It is thought that he should be given the privilege of voluntarily de- parting. Please allow him a reasonable time within which to depart, and advise as to the outcome. By direction of the Commissioner, TLA:FB W. W. BROWN, Assistant. a TLM (Signed) APR 12 1935 MAILED 20
