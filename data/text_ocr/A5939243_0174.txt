PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO RESPONDENT: or Did you sign a register for a marriage certificate? A No, sir. Q As far as you know, there were no records made of your marriage. Is that correct? A Yes, sir. of Was your first marriage ever legally terminated in any way? A Yes, sir. of How? A We were divorced. of When were you divorced? A Sometime in 1931. Q And where was the divorce obtained? A In Manila, Philippine Islands. or Your former wife obtained it--is that right? A Yes, sir. Q Do you have any documentary evidence of that divorce? A No. I got a letter from her-I would say back in 1932--and also a letter from my brother ALEX informing me that she has divorced me. COUNSEL TO RESPONDENT: of Where is that letter? A I think I gave it to Mr. Scallorn--whoever gave ne the hearing at that time--I didn't get it back. of In other words, a member of the Immigration Service did see the letter in con- nection with the hearing in your case? A Yes, sir. I think you will find the letter together with my original discharge from the ship in New Orleans in 1928. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO RESPONDENT: of You are advised that there is no such letter or ship discharge contained in your Los Angeles file. There is a Certificate of Seaman's Service, which has already been marked Exhibit 3 in your case. I show you that now, and ask you if that is a copy of the discharge to which you refer? A Yes, sir. a Do you have any papers or documents at all which would establish a legal ter- mination of your marriage in the Philippine Islands? A No, sir. 16542/2238 -28- 10-23-44
