Screened by NARA, 9/14/2022 methods of determining English proficiency, or demonstrate civics knowledge, as required by Section 312 of the INA..." Loss of cognitive abilities based on the direct effect of the illegal use of drugs is not covered as a disability. PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING THE EXCEPTIONS In order to base its adjudications of requests for the disability exceptions on solid medical evidence, the INS requires all persons seeking an exception to submit a new form N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions, to be completed by a licensed medical doctor or a licensed clinical psychologist. These certifying professionals must have a state license to practice in the United States (including the U.S. territories of Guam, Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands). They must be experienced in diagnosing persons with physical disabilities or mental impairments. They must attest to the origin, nature, and extent of the medical condition as it relates to the exceptions for English and civics. The medical certification form may be submitted in support of requests for both the English proficiency and civics knowledge exceptions. Form N-648 may be photocopied. Forms may be obtained from local INS district offices, or by calling the INS Forms Center at 1-800-870- FORM. By the end of March, applicants may also call 1-800-755-0777 for information about the disability exceptions. Hearing impaired individuals may call 1-800-767-1TDD between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., weekdays. Under penalty of perjury, both the applicant and the medical professional must attest that all information submitted is true and correct. A legal guardian may sign the N-648 authorizing the release of additional medical records to the Service. The INS reserves the right to request a doctor or an applicant to submit additional supporting evidence. The INS may also require a second certification from another qualified professional in cases where the Service has credible doubts about the veracity of a medical certification initially presented. Persons with disabilities who are not seeking an exception to the English*and civics requirements do not need to submit Form N-648. In conformance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, INS will continue to provide reasonable modifications in its testing procedures to enable naturalization applicants who have disabilities to participate in the process. Examples of such modifications may include providing sign language interpreters, wheelchair-accessible test sites, or modifications in test format or administration procedures, among others. 4
