All 142 299 3770 E. Jefferson Avenue Detroit 7, Michigan July 2, 1958 Mr. Eugan Ali 2007 Jos. Campau Detroit, Michigan Dear Sir: Reference is made to your recent registration at this office as an alien. It is noted that you did not register in 1940 as required, since you believed yourself to be a citizen of the United States. As a result of your registration, this Service is unable to issue an Alien Registration Receipt Card, Form I-151, for the reason we have been unable to verify your entry for permanent residence as claimed. Therefore, the enclosed document has been created from your record of registration. It was issued to serve only as evidence that you have complied with the law. It is not, however, a Border Crossing Card. Under the provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, you may file an application to have a record of your entry for permanent residence created. Should you wish to apply it is suggested that you communicate with this office and request Form N-105. For your information, the fee for making application to have a record created is $25.00. Very truly yours, John M. Bonds Acting District Director SSW/ev iss
