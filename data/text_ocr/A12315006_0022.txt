inf RECEIVED WALTER C. HUEBNER WOOD ROAD, R. D. NO. 1 in NEWARSERVICE N. J. MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY SEP 15 AM 9." September 13, 1961 Immigration and Naturalization Service United States Department of Justice 1060 Broad Street Newark, New Jersey File: A 12315006 Gentlemen: You have on record all the documents (including administering the oath) necessary for issuance to me of a certificate of citizenship with the exception of more positive proof of the birth of my father. You suggested that the Bureau of Census may be able to demonstrate that he actually resided in the United States prior to my birth. The attached letter just received from The Bureau of Census does, I believe, establish that fact. In addition, I was able to obtain the enclosed photostat from the files of my father's former employer - Thomas A. Edison Industries of West Orange, New Jersey - which had been attested to, I think, for Social Security requirements. I trust this will enable you to issue the requested certificate. Very truly yours, Walter Hueberr WCH:nw Encls.
