Stanford Avenue. She registered for this room under the name of Marie Guidry. The witness moved in with her shortly thereafter and they re- sided together at this hotel for about three and one half months. Mr. Willingham then registered for a room at the Lyndon Hotel, 413 East 7th Street, Los Angeles, where he lived with Mrs. Paps for another three and one-half months. Mrs. Paps left the witness to return to her husband about three months ago, telling the witness at that time that her only reason for this action was to help the subject adjust his imnigration status. She said that the subject and his attorney had contacted her and told her that the only way the subject could remain in the United States was for her to resume living with him. She told the witness that she intended to leave her husband again after his immigration status was straightened out and that she wanted to come back and live with Willingham after she had divorced her husband. The witness stated that he has no in- tention of taking her back and that he doesn't care to have anything more to do with her; that she lied about her age when they started going to- gether, saying that she was thirty=four years old, but he later learned that she is about thirty-nine or forty years old. Mr. Willingham said that he is twenty-five years old and that Mrs. Paps is too old for him. He said that Mrs. Paps never gave any reason for having left her husband but always spoke as if he had treated her well during their married life together. She did tell the witness that her husband gambled heavily on the horse races and frequently would lose all the money she had earned for her job as a waitress. Mr. Willingham said that the fight which took place at the subject's house resulted when he went to return Mrs. Paps' watch which she had left in Los Angeles to be repaired. He said that when he entered the house the subject started to argue with him and they finally came to blows. He contended that he had no intention of causing trouble when he went to the house. ALOMAH HOTEL, 640 SOUTH STANFORD AVENUE, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. This is one of the hotels where Mr. Willingham said he lived with Mrs. Paps. On September 26, 1944, Mrs. Timberlake, manager of the hotel, was interviewed. She produced her hotel register which showed that on August 25, 1943, a Marie Guidry registered for a room. Mrs. Timberlake said that she remembered Marie Guidry very well and that shortly after she registered she was joined by a Mr. Willingham who moved in with her. Marie Guidry told the witness that Willingham was her husband and as the witness had no reason to doubt this, she permitted them to continue to live there together. They left during February, 1944 and moved to the Lyndon Hotel on 7th Street. Mrs. Timerlake stated that she knew nothing about Marie Guidry's personal life but that she seemed to be a very nice woman. She worked all of the time while Willingham was just a loafer and didn't work at all. The wit- ness saw Miss Guidry after she moved away and she then told Mrs. Timberla that Willingham was not her husband but that she had left her husband to live with him. She told the witness that her husband had always treated her very kindly and when asked why she didn't return to him she said it was because she was ashamed to. LYNDON HOTEL, 413 EAST 7TH STREET, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA. This is the address of the other hotel where Mr. Willingham stated he and Mrs. Paps resided together. On September 26, 1944, Flora M.
