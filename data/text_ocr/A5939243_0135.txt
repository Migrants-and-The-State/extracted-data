-2- I went to the Philippine Islands with the 16th U.S. Infantry. After my discharge in 1902, I remained in the Islands, engaged in business and remained a resident of the Islands until December 31, 1931 when I returned to the United States, My family joined me a year later. From the time of the occupation of the American Troops until the passing of the Philippine Flag Law which was sometime either in late 1917 or early 1918, which changed the flying of Old Glory to the flying of the Philippine Flag from every public building and school in the entire Archipelago, all Americans were led to believe that all children born of American parents remained Americans, but those of any other nationality were considered Filipinos. During the year of 1928 while I was engaged in the hotel business in the Port of Legaspi, Albay Province, Island of Luzon, Philip came to pay us a visit and expressed the desire to come to the United States. As there was an American ship in port at the time I spoke to the Captain and was able to get Philip a berth as deckhand. As near as I can remember Philip had to ship out as a Filipino as the shipping laws forbid the hiring of any other nation- ality for service on American ships leaving any port in the Phili- ppine Islands. That I cannot say positively but I do know that he left for the United States on this particular ship, and on her re- turn trip I was told by the Chief Officer that Philip had remained in New Orleans and had been paid off there. He was residing in New Orleans, Louisana when I arrived in the United States on January 21, 1932. After the arrival of my family in 1933, Philip came to Los Angeles, California to visit his sister, who is my wife, and he remained here.
