Case WONG QUEN LUCK: Sir: There are endèeed herewith for return to the court's record, from which they were temporarily withdrawn two inmigration files which have been returned to this office by the Bureau of Imigration. One of these files is marked "Respondent's Exhibit A", and is in the identical condition that it was when withdrawn free the court record. The other file, when withfrawn had upon it R back placed there by the Clerk of the Court, and marked *Respondent's Exhibit B" . Through inadvortence, however, the back was removed and destroyed in the Bureau. It is hoped that your office will have no difficulty, however, in having the last mentioned file identified and returned to the court record.
