8097/4240 - 5 - - 10/17/35 (Q. Cont.) why you should not be deported in conformity with law? A. No, but I think when I first applied for my papers I should have been advised that I was illegally here in the United States. It took them 61/200 years to find out I was illegally here and that is pretty tough. I have learned a trade here that I have to be a citizen to hold it and I think that is a long time I have wasted for my age. Q. What trade have you learned? A. I work in race tracks, Mr. Scallorn. Q. In addition to the charges stated in the warrant of arrest, it is further charged that you should be deported from the United States on the following grounds: That you are in the United States in violation of the Immigration Act of 1924 in that at the time of your entry you were not in possession of an unexpired immigration visa, and you are now given an opportunity to show cause why you should not be deported under this further charge as well as those named in the warrant. Have you anything to say or any evidence to offer in this regard? A. Well, Mr. Scallorn, all the time I thought I was a subject of the United States being born in the Philippines and I am not so sure but I think the way I came on the Dryden they never asked me what nationality, just where Iwas born when they signed me on, and I believe I entered the United States as a Philippine citizen and subject of the United States. Q. When did you first know you were a subject of Great Britain? A. Not until I heard from you people. That is when I first heard. Q. Do you consider yourself a subject of Great Britain? A. No, sir. because I never swore to the English flag. Q. In your statement to Inspector Erbs on February 21, 1935 you stated as follows: "Q. Of what country are you now a citizen or subject? A. Citizen of Great Britain, because my father was a naturalized citizen of Great Britain and naturalized in England before I was born." Why did you SO testify? A. That is what he said, if my father was an Englishman I was English too, but I never swore to the English flag. I can go to the Philippines today and vote there as a Philippine citizen because I was born out there. Q. Why did you state on February 21, 1935 that you were a citizen of Great Britain? A. I do not know. Q. Is there any one in the United States who is dependent upon you for support? A. No, sir. Q. Are you employed at the present time? A. No, sir. Q. Do you. own any property in the United States? A. No, sir. 8097/4240 -5- 10/17/35
