However, on review of the applicable statutes. it does not appear that respondent is a citizen of the Philippine Islands by reason of his birth therein. On July 1, 1902, the United States Congress, in accord- ance with the Treaty of Paris, whereby Spain ceded the Philippine Islands to the United States, enacted a statute (22 Stat. 691). Section 4 of which provided that all inhabitants of the Philippine Islands continuing to reside therein, who were Spanish Subjects on April 11, 1899, and who then resided in the Islands and their children born sub- sequent thereto shall be deemed to be Philippine citizens except for those who elected to preserve their allegiance to Spain in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. On March 23. 1912, (33 Stat. 77) the Act of July 1, 1902 was amended authorizing the Philippine legislature to provide by law for the acquisition of Philippine citizenship by those natives of the Philippine Islands not coming within the foregoing provision.

Under the authorization thus granted by Congress, the Philippine Legislature enacted on March 26, 1920, the Philippine Naturalization Law (Act No. 2927) which provided for acquisition of Philippine citizen- ship by natives of the Philippine Islands who were not already citizens thereof.
