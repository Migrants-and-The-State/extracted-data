U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IMMIGRATION SERVICE IN ANSWERING REFER TO No:14438/6-20 OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER ANGEL ISLAND STATION VIA FERRY POST OFFICE SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. August 25, 1917. United States Attorney, Postoffice Building, 7th and Missi on Sts., San Francisco, California. Sir: The following is quoted from a copy of a letter sent to the Secretary of Labor by the Solicitor-General dated August 8, 1917, in respect to the question of securing a review by the Supreme Court of the recent decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Wong Quen Luck on habeas corpus: "I have carefully examined the case, and find that the record is in such shape that even though a writ of certiorari could be obtained, it is not likely that a reversal of the judgment below could be brought about. It is unfortunate that a stenographic report of the entire proceedings in the trial court was not had in order that the record might show just what took place, and how far the Chinaman succeeded in es- tablishing his claim that he had not been accorded a fair hearing because a proper interpreter had not been supplied by the immigration officials. On the record as it stands it must be assumed that the Chinaman amply supported his con- tention, and in that situation a higher court, in the interest of justice, would hesitate to reverse the judgment entered in the case." You will note that the Solicitor-General considered it unfortunate that a stenographic report of the proceedings in the District Court was not had. Respectfully, M CDM/ASH day by Commissioner.
