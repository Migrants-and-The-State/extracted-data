U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IMMIGRATION SERVICE OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. 14438/6-20 January 14,1916. Commissioner-General of Immigration, Washington. The Bureau's attention is respectfully called to the condition of its file when recently returned to this office in the case of wong Quen Luck, Bureau NO54605/52. After wong Quen Luck had been ordered discharged on habeas corpus by Judge Dooling, the said file, which had been temporarily withdrawn from the court's record under an order secured from the Court , was sent to the Bureau with a report of the Court proceedings in order to enable the Bureau and the Department to determine whether an appeal should be taken. When the file was so sent it had a paper back placed thereon by the Clerk of the Court at the time it was admitted in evidence in the habeas corpus proceeding, upon which back the Clerk, etekehia sig- nature, marked the file "Respondent's Exhibit A"so When the file was returned by the Bureau it was found that the said back placed thereon by the Clerk of the Court was missing. The Buraan will readily appreciate that the removal of the identification marks placed upon the Exhibit in a case after the Exhibit has been temporarily withdrawn from the court record may prove a serious matter when it comes to filing the Exhibit for
