Screened by NARA, 9/14/2022 THE MEDICAL CERTIFICATION (INS FORM N-648) FOR THE DISABILITY EXCEPTIONS A person who qualifies as disabled for other government benefit program is not necessarily unable to learn or demonstrate English proficiency or civics knowledge for naturalization. The certifying doctor or psychologist must assess the applicant's disability or impairment(s) to determine whether they are of such a degree as would prevent the applicant from being able to meet the basic English and civics requirements for naturalization as described above. Some individuals will have disabilities that qualify them for certain financial and other public benefits, but that do not prevent them from learning and demonstrating the ordinary English proficiency and civics knowledge required for citizenship. Questions #1 and #2 on Form N-648 request basic factual information; and are self- explanatory. The INS must know that the applicant was in fact examined, the date of such examination, and had an assessment made of his or her condition. Question #3 requires a diagnosis of the applicant's disability or impairment, and the certifier's assessment as to why the disability or impairment would prevent the applicant from meeting the English and/or civics requirements. If there is a mental impairment, the certifier must provide the DSM diagnosis. Question #4 requires that the certifier address whether the applicant's disability resulted from the illegal use of drugs. If applicant's condition was caused by the illegal use of drugs he or she is ineligible for the disability exceptions. Additionally, the certifier must specify when the developmental disability was first manifested, since under the regulation, the condition must have occurred prior to age 22. Question #5 requires that the certifier address the duration of the applicant's disability because only permanent disabilities (i.e. in existence 12 months or longer) meet the criteria for the exceptions. Question #6 requires a statement of medical speciality. The certifier must demonstrate how his or her education and experience qualify him or her to make this assessment of the applicant's physical or developmental disabilities or mental impairments. The certifier must also provide the INS with his or her state medical license number and licensing state for verification by the INS. 5
