BY COUNSEL: Don't worry, she wouldn't go back to you? BY WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Yes. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: of Why did you tell the inspector who interviewed you that she had told you that, if that is not a correct statement? COUNSEL TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Were you still sore, Mr. Willingham? A I guess I was just mad, I don't know. PRESIDING INSPECTOR to WITNESS WILLINGHAM: of Mad at whom? A I was just mad because she went back. Q Because who went back? A Mrs. Paps. of Then it is your testimony at this time that Mrs. Paps did not tell you that she intended to leave her husband again as soon as his immigration status was straightened out and return to you--is that correct? A No. sir, she did not say that. Q According to this report of investigation you stated to the inspector who inter- viewed you that Mrs. Paps told you that her husband gambled heavily on the horse races and frequently would lose all the money she had earned for her job as a waitress. Did Mrs. Paps tell you that? A Yes. sir. Q When did she tell you that? A When we lived together. Q At where? A It was there on East Seventh, in the Linden Hotel. or And that was sometime during this three and one-half months period before she left you about May or June 1944? A That's right. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO WITNESS MRS. PAPS: of You have heard the testimony of the witness. J. D. Willingham. Do you have my comment to make on it? A Well, I don't remember ever telling him that my husband gambled or anything like that. 16542/2238 -43- 6-19-45
