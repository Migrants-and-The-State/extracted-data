Commissioner of Immigration, (Thro' Chinese Inspr. in Charge), Angel Island, California. In re WONG QUEN LUCK, Son of Nat., Riverside, California, ex/ s/s KOREA, June 21, 1915: I have taken the statement of applicant. Alleged father and witness are said to reside near Riverside, Cal., and the record should be forwarded there for further investigation. This applicant is unable to give any definite date as to when his father was in China last, and it is therefore requested that any and all trips that his alleged father may have made, giving the year, month, day, steamer, port of embarcation, port of arrival, occupation, be secured; also, all papers the alleged father may have pertaining to his nativity should be taken up and forwarded with the case. The testimony of applicant was given in a very hesitating and evasive manner, and at times it required several minutes to get an anser to a simple question. WDH/PAM. (SGD) W. D, HEITMANN, Immigrant Inspector. 7
