INSTRUCTIONS TO THE APPLICANT (Tear off this instruction sheet before filling out this form) This form is not for adopted children. It must be completely filled in in ink or on a typewriter. If you do not have enough room for any answer or if the instructions tell you to use a separate sheet of paper, use another sheet this size, giving the answer the same number as the number of the question, and attach it to the appli- cation. You will later be notified to appear for examination before an officer of the Immigration and Naturali- zation Service, with the person (s) through whom you claim citizenship, if living, or some other identifying witness, if deceased. AGE OF APPLICANT.-Applicant 14 years of age or over must sign their full names, but only in the space provided on page 3 of this application. If under 14 years, only the parent or guardian must sign his or her name, and only in the space provided on page 3. FEE.-A remittance of five dollars ($5) must accompany this application. DO NOT SEND CASH IN THE MAIL. If you mail your application, attach a money order or check, payable to Immigration and Nat- uralization Service, Department of Justice. (Exceptions: If you reside in the Virgin Islands, remittance must be payable to Commissioner of Finance, Virgin Islands; and if in Guam, to Treasurer, Guam.) The fee is required for filing the application, and is not returnable, regardless of action taken thereon. PHOTOGRAPHS.-Yo are required to send with this application three unglazed photographs of your- self taken within 30 days of the date of this application. These photographs must be 2 by 2 inches in size and the distance from top of head to point of chin should be approximately 11/4 inches; must not be pasted on a card or mounted in any other way; must be on thin paper, have a light background, and clearly show a front view of your face without hat. Snapshots, group, or full-length portraits will not be accepted. YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS MUST NOT BE SIGNED, but you should print your name and alien registration number, if any, in the center of the back of each photograph lightly with a soft lead pencil, taking care not to mutilate the photograph. They may be in natural color or in black and white, but black and white photographs which have been tinted or otherwise colored are not acceptable. FACTS CONCERNING ARRIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES.-Detailed information should be given in Statement 3 regarding your first arrival in the United States for permanent residence in this country. The information regarding the number of the passport and date and place of issuance does not need to be given unless you traveled on a United States passport at that time. If you do not know the exact date of arrival or name of the vessel or port and cannot obtain this information, give the facts of your arrival to the best of your ability. If you have an alien registration receipt card, immigrant identification card, ship's card, or baggage labels, they will help you to give this information. RACE.-With regard to Statements 15 and 17, you should show race as white, or of African nativity or descent, or any other race that is applicable. DOCUMENTS.-If your birth abroad, or the birth abroad of any person through whom citizenship is claimed, was registered with an American Consul there, submit with this application any registration form that was issued. If any required documents were submitted to and retained by the American Consul, and you wish to use such documents in connection with this application instead of submitting a duplicate, list them in Statement 14 of the application and show the location of the consulate. If you wish to make similar use of required documents contained in any Immigration and Naturalization Service file, list them in Statement 14 and identify the file by name, number, and location. Otherwise, the documents mentioned in the box on page 6 applicable to your case (see over) must accompany your application and, for any required document not fur- nished, you must explain why; what efforts you have made to get it; and, if possible, enclose a statement from the official custodian of such records showing that the document is not available. You should also forward for consideration, in lieu of that document, a record or the affidavits described under SECONDARY EVIDENCE, on the reverse of this page. If any person through whom citizenship is claimed became a citizen through his or her parent(s), but does not have a certificate of citizenship (with a number preceded by an A or AA) in his or her own name, commu- nicate with the Immigration and Naturalization Service for information as to additional documents which must be submitted.
