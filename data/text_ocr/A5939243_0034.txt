U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE Immigration and Naturalization Service Marking Determined Los Angeles District October 10, 1944 File No. 16542/2238 to be CONFIDENTIAL REPORT OF INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION PHILIP MICHAEL PAPS alias JOSEPH PHILIP ROSS This confidential report is submitted in accordance with existing instructions relating to applicants for suspension of deportation. This report, which is made separate from the regular report of investigation, contains statements made in confidence and therefore is not to be intro- duced as evidence in the warrant hearing record. On September 2, 1944, Mr. W. F. Hicks of 1255 Federal Avenue was interviewed. Mr. Hicks is manager of the court where the subject is presently residing in number 1257-3/4. This witness gave the following information, which he desires be kept strictly confidential: The sub- ject has resided in the court for about the period claimed. Mrs. Paps was working as a waitress when she and her husband moved here, and she continued to work until she ran away with a man named Willingham. She lived with this man in Los Angeles for six or seven months and finally returned to her husband about two months ago. Upon her return she told Mr. Hicks that the only reason she came back was to help the subject to straighten out his immigration case. She told Mr. Hicks that the subject gambles a lot and loses all of their money. She quit her job about three weeks ago because of ill health, saying the doctor told her she had a bad heart and was in a nervous, run-down condition. On August 28th she went to live with her husband's sister in Tarzana. About the 26th of July this year, Willingham came to the subject's house, went in and started talking to Mrs. Paps. He and the subject then started to argue and finally to fight. Hr. Hicks called the police and they arrested Willingham. He was brought to trial and pleaded guilty to a battery charge and was fined $25. This witness said that he heard that Mrs. Paps had run away with Willingham once before and that the subject had gone to Louisiana to bring her back. Mr. Hicks declared that he has a very poor opinion of the sub- ject because he believes that any man who would take back a woman who has run away with another man, expecially the second time, displays a decided lack of character. He said that the subject has been a good tenant except for the one disturbance when the fight with Willingham occurred. Roberthruff Robert L. Tripp Investigator.
