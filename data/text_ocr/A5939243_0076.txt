COUNSEL TO PRESIDING INSPECTOR: Q When was that, Inspector? A I don't know. I will have to ask him. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Will you give the date that Mrs. Paps left the Linden Hotel on East Seventh Street? A Last year--I don't know what date it was. Q Do you know approximately when? A Over a year ago. Q How much over a year? A Its been about a year and three months, something like that. Q According to the information given by you as shown in this report of investi- gation, which is dated October 10, 1944 â‚« you stated about one year ago Mrs. Paps left her husband and came to Los Angeles, where she rented a room in the Aloma Hotel, that she remained at that hotel for about three and one-half months, and that she then moved to the Linden Hotel, where she remained for another three and one-half months before leaving to go back to her husband. According to this information she would have left the Linden Hotel about May or June 1944. Do you know whether or not that is the approximate time? A That is about right, yes. Q Now according to this report of investigation you told the inspector who inter- viewed you that Mrs. Paps told you she intended to leave her husband again after his immigration status was straightened out, and that she wanted to come back and live with you after she had divorced her husband. Did Mrs. Paps tell you that? A No, I told her when she left that there wasn't any use coming back, and she said, "Don't worry", she wouldn't. 16542/2238 -42- 6-19-45
