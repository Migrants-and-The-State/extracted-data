U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IMMIGRATION SERVICE OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. NO. 14438/6-20 August 5, 1915. Memorandum for the Commissioner. In re Wong Quen Luck, alleged son of merchant, ex "B""Korea" g June 21, 1915. The American nativity of the alleged father is satisfactorily established, he having been admitted as such at three different times, the second time from the essential trip, ex 98 "Gaolic", May 20, 1899, and the last time NO.102, ex 83 "Korea" , October 9, 1909. The examining inspector reports adversely in this case because of certain discrepancies contained in the testimony . One of said discrepancies, to my mind is in itself sufficient to warrant denial. It will be noted that applicant remembers his father having been in China some eight or nine years ago, but does not remember the exact date . The fact that alleged father actually was in China in 1909, and now states that his father died in S.T.3(1931), he having received a letter to that effect from his wife, and further states that his father and mother always lived in the same house ever since he married, his wife, clearly shows that he is not the father of the present applicant, who testifies that he never saw his paternal grand- father and does not where he died, but was told by his mother that he, know the paternal grandfather, died in C.R.1 (1912). He only changed his statement as to whom he received that information from after having first stated that his father told him about his paternal grandfather's death, and having had his attention called to the fact that he had stated his father had not been in Chinaduring the last eight or nine years. The remaining discrepancies are also more or less serious and also tend to show more clearly that a fraudulent claim has been advanced in this case. As applicant has failed to satisfactorily establish the relationship claimed to his alleged father, denial is recommended in this cass. (ssgd.) L.LÂ°renzen LL/LM Inspector, Law Section. 28
