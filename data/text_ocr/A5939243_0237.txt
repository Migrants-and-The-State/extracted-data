U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION SERVICE Phila. 55894/502 December 12, 1942 DEC 16 1942 Commandant of the Coast Guard Navy Department Washington, D. C. Sir: It is desired to call your attention to the case of one PHILIP MICHAEL PAPS, alina JOSEPH P. ROSS, who is now serving in the United States Coast Guard. Mr. Paps arrived in the United States at the port of New Orleans, Louisiana on November 5, 1928. Deportation proceed- ings were instituted against this alien in view of the fact that after entering this country he has remained for a longer time than permitted under the Immigration Act of 1924 or rog- ulations made thereunder. No further action will be taken in the deportation pro- ceedings while Mr. Paps is a member of the armed forces of this country. It will be appreciated, however, if prior to Mr. Paps' discharge this office is notified in regard thereto, so that such action as may be appropriate at that time may be taken. Sincerely yours, SIGNED Earl G. Harrison DEC 14 1942 COMMISSIONER MAILED By: B Herman R. Landon, Acting Chief Warrant and Deportation Branch Copy to DD Los Angeles, referring to his file 16542/2238. file
