manager, examined her records which showed that a Mr. and Mrs. Willingham registered on February 29, 1944, and were assigned room #43. Mrs. Paling said that they lived here as man and wife until the latter part of June when the woman known to her as Mrs. Willingham, left. She said that they were a quiet couple at first but toward the last of their stay in the hotel they started to have poker games in their room and became quite noisy. After Mrs. Willingham left, the parties became even noisier and Mrs. Paling finally asked Mr. Willingham to move. The witness stated that Mrs. Willingham worked as a waitress at Roy's Cafe on 7th Street near Maple Avenue and at the Victory Cafe on 7th Street near San Julian. A check of the employment re- cord at Roy's Cafe, 232 East 7th Street, disclosed that a Miss Guidry was em- ployed there for a short time.
