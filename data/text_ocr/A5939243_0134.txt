Tarzana, California 23rd June, 1944 To whom it may conern: "Greetings": (Identification and recommendation of and for PHILIP M. PAPS, a resident of Los Angeles, California.) In 1913 while I resided in the City of Manila, Philippine Islands, I became acquainted with a Greek gentleman by the name of MITCHELL JOHN PAPS. Mr. Paps and I became close friends and as I was a frequent visitor at his home, I therefore naturally became familiar with his family which consisted of the following persons: his wife, Rebecca, a daughter, Elisabeth and a son,David, which two were Mr. Paps' step-children, he having married a widow, and his children by his wife, Rebecca, namely, Lillie, Philip, John, Alexander, and Violet. I was always told that of his children, Lillie was born in Singapore, Straits Settlement, Philip born in Davao Province, Island of Mindanao, and the rest born in Manila, Philippine Islands. I was also led to believe that Mr. Mitchell Paps was a registered British subject due to his being employed for a number of years by the British Go vernment in Singapore, as well as in South Africa. Mr Paps was a Civil Engineer by profession. Mr. Paps died March, 1918 in the City of Manila. In April 1922, I married Lillie P. Paps and our marriage certificate states that she is a British subject having been born in Singapore. She became an American Citizen by virtue of her marriage to me as the law regarding Aliens marrying American citizens did not pass until September, 1922. Exhibit Case of No 20
