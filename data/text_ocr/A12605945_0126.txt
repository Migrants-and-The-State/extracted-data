U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IMMIGRATION SERVICE IN ANSWERING REFER TO No. 14438/6-20 OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER ANGEL ISLAND STATION VIA FERRY POST OFFICE SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. August 24, 1917. Commi and oner-General or Immigration, Washington, De C. Referring to office telegram to the Bureau dated August 17, 1917, in the matter of long Quen Luck, Bureau No. 54005/52, it is very m2ah regretted that the Circuit Court of Appeals has denied the motion of the United States Attorney's office for an extension of time to enable this Service to conduct another hearing, the Court (Judge Norrow sponking), while recognising that it lay within its discretionary power to grant the motion, expressed the opinion that the facts as disclosed by the imigration record did not justify the exercise of the power. It might be well to mention that the Court in no way in- not timated that we were remiss in/having proceeded to veher the case pending the determination by the Department of Justice whether a review by the Supreme Court should be sought. Our not having so proceeded seems clearly right, for what this Department was primarily interested in was a review of the principle involved in the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, the matter of again determining whether this particular applicant was admissible being of secondary importance. To have proceeded with the hearing would have been in- consistent with a proceeding looking to a review of the Circuit Court
