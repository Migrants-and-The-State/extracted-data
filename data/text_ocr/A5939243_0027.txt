of information concerning his living with respondent's wife and stated also that Mrs. Paps told him that respondent "gambled heavily on horse races and frequently would lose all the money she had earned for her job as a waitress". Mr. Willingham, however, when called to testify at the respondent's hearing, and when confronted with the report of investigation, stated that it was not true that Mrs. Paps had given him this information and that he only stated that to the investigator because he was angry at Mr. Paps. The witness testified that previous to his furnishing this information he had some trouble with Mr. Paps at the respondent's house as a result of which he was fined $25 for disturb- ing the peace (pp. 48, 49(. Respondent presented notarized affidavits from two United States citizens attesting to his good moral character during the past five years (Ex. 9. 10) and a letter from his employer stating that he is an honest, conscientious, and reliable employee (Ex. 14). Exhibits 17 and 18, respectively, are clearances from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office and the Los Angeles Police Depart- ment indicating that the respondent has no local police record other than an immigration arrest for illegal entry in 1936. It is found that the respondent has been a person of good moral character during the past five years. No evidence was developed indicating that the respondent is subject to deportation on any of the grounds specified in Section 19(d) of the Im- nigration Act of 1917, as amended. V. SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION - PROPOSED FINDINGS OF FACT Upon the basis of all the evidence presented, it is found: (1) That the respondent is a person of the white race; (2) That the respondent has been a person of good moral character during the past five years; (3) That deportation of the respondent would result in serious economic detriment to his United States citizen wife; (4) That after full inquiry no facts have been developed which establish that the respondent is deportable on any of the grounds specified in Section 19(a) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended. VI. SUSPENSION OF DEPORTATION - PROPOSED CONCLUSION OF LAW Upon the basis of the foregoing findings of fact, it is concluded: (1) That under Section 19(c)(2) of the Immigration Act of 1917, as amended, the respondent is eligible for sus- pension of deportation. 7
