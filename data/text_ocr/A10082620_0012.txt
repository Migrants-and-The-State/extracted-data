Joseph Babisz 4155 North Rowhand Avenue El Monte, California September 4, 1964 U. S. Department of Justice Immigration & Naturalization Service 510 South Vermont Avenue Los Angeles 5, California Gentleman; This is to notify you that my Mother Maria Babisz past away on August 22, 1964. Because she was admitted to the Unite States as an immigrant I would like to know where should I send the Alien Card and whom should I notify. At the present I am holding the Alien Card # 10082620. Thank you kindly for your co-operation. Sincerely yours, Balrdy Joseph Babisz
