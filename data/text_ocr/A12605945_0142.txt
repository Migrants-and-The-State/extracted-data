6.- To.14438/6-20 This office feels that 1Â£ the facts just pointed out are clearly and forcibly presented to the Circuit Court of Appeals with citations and discussions of the many decisions of its own and the Supreme Court that are applicable to this case, there is good reason to hope that of rehearing will be grented, and the lower court entirely reversed. It is understood that in the event of the court's adhering to its opinion, this step would not be a bar to a subsequent proceeding in the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. Mention should be made of the unusual action of the Court in this case in issuing the mandate at the time of the filing of the opinion, instead of complying with the usual practice of withholding the issuance of the mandate for thirty days after sich filing. The widhdrawal of the man- date, it would seem, would therefore be necessary in ordet to again give the court jurisdiction to consider a rehearing. The reporting of this decision to the Bureau has been somewhat delayed by the absence on official business of Asst. U. S. Attorney Ornbaun, who has handled the case for the U. S. Attorney, and with whom this office has been desirious of consulting before addressing the Bureau. However, as Mr. Ornbaun has not yet returned, and it now appears that he will be away for several days longer, it is thought advisable to go ahead and report, as any action that may be decided upon should be taken promptly. Just as soon as he returns the matter will be taken up with him, and the Bureau will be advised by telegraph whether he views with favor the filing of a petition for a rehearing, or whatever else he thinks should be done.
