PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Do you have any additional remarks to make? A No. sir. 2 You have heard the testimony of Mrs. Paps in which she testified that she did not tell you that her husband gambled heavily and that she did not tell you that Mr. Paps and his attorney had contacted her regarding Mr. Paps' case. What do you have to say to that? A I guess that's right. Q What's right? COUNSEL TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Mrs. Paps' statement is right? A Yes. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Do you mean that it is now your statement that she did not tell you that re- garding this attorney and Mr. Paps1 contacting her? A No, she didn't. Q Is it also your statement at the present time that she did not tell you that her husband gambled heavily on horse races? A She told me that he gambled and played the horses some, but she didn't say heavily. or What did she tell you about his gampling, if anything? A Oh, she didn't tell me much about it. She said he played the horses once in a while, that's all. Q Do you know that you are under oath at this hearing to tell the truth, as I advised you at the beginning of your testimony? A Yes. Q Do you remember my advising you regarding the penalties of perjury? A Yes. Q What was your reason for giving such information to the inspector who inter- viewed you, that is, regarding Mr. Paps and an attorney contacting his wife and about Mr. Paps gambling heavily and losing money on the horse races-what was your reason for giving that information to our inspector if you state now that it is not true? A I don't know. Q You mean you don't know why you told the inspector that? A No. She told me he gambled some. 16542/2238 -45- 6-19-45
