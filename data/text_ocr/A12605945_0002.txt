File: 29158/7-27 District Director August 22, 1960 Los Angeles, California Samuel O. Brunson, Acting Assistant District Director, Travel Control Branch, San Francisco, California Your OI 205.3 report request; July 27, 1960; Wong Quen Luck ATTENTION: Emmett D. Kelliher, Asst. District Director, Travel Control Branch Wong Quen Luck first arrived at this port on the SS "Korea" On June 21, 1915, and applied for admission as the son of Wong Shoon Jung aka Wong Shew King, who was alleged to have been born in San Francisco in 1874. Wong Shoon Jung arrived in San Francisco on June 19, 1888, and was declared to be a native by the United States Circuit Court, habeas corpus case 7580, on January 11, 1889. Because of discrepancies in his arrival testimony, Wong Quen Luck was denied admission to the United States as not having established his rela- tionship to Wong Shoon Jung. After a dismissal of his appeal, Wong Quen Luck filed an action in the United States District Court, San Francisco, which discharged him as a United States citizen. This Service appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld the decision of the District Court. The case was again appealed by the Service to the Supreme Court, which, as reported by a letter dated August 25, 1917, upheld the decision of the lower courts. At the time of Wong Quen Luck's arrival in 1915, he claimed that he was born in Wah Hing Village, S.N.D., on KS 25-7-21 and that he was not married. On January 20, 1921, in a pre-departure statement made at Riverside, California, Wong Quen Luck asserted that he had one sister, no brothers, namely Wong Ngon, age 12, "now married" (It appears that "now married" probably meant "not married". and that he had never been married. He departed from this port on June 2, 1921, and returned on the SS "President Pierce" on May 5, 1923, again being admitted as a returning United States citizen. He then claimed that he was married to Lee Shee on CR 10-6-16 ("She is now living at Wo Hing Village, S.N.D.") and that he had one son, Wong Fee Hong, born CR 11-8-6. On July 26, 1926, Wong Quen Lock again applied for a Citizen's Return Permit and stated at San Bernardino, California, that he was married to Lee Shee on CR 10-6-16 at Wah Hing Village, and that he had one son born CR 11-8-6.00] departed from this port on File 8-23-60
