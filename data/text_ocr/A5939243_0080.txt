Q What about this attorney contacting her-why did you tell the inspector that if you state now that it isn't the truth? A Well, she said something at the time about his talking to her, but I don't know what it was about. Q This information which you apparently gave to the inspector is quite definite. Why did you definitely state to him that such were the true facts? A I don't know, I guess I was just mad. Q When was the last time that you had seen Mr. Paps before your hearing today? A Well, I seen him getting out of his car and going into the bank, I guess, and I walked by and I spoke to him and he spoke to me. Q When was that? A That was one day last week. Q Did you have any conversation with Mr. Paps at that time? A No. Q When had you seen him before that? A Oh, it's been about four or five months since I seen him. Q Previous to the hearing today when did you see Mrs. Paps last? A The same day I saw him. She was with him in the car. Q Did you have any conversation with her at that time? A No. Q Have you ever had any conversation with either Mr. or Mrs. Paps concerning your testifying at his immigration hearing? A No. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO COUNSEL: Q Do you wish to question the witness? A By all means. COUNSEL TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Mr. Willingham, you haven't seen me before, have you?
