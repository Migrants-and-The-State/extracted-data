THE silk S.C.EVANS, PRESIDENT. P.T.EVANS, SECRETARY. LAND F IRRIGATING CO. M 9: December 28, 1915. enjoy Edward White, Commissioner, S. 6 F. CAL. U.S. Department of Labor, 95 Immigration Service, DEC Angel Island Station, via Ferry P.O. 29. San Francisco, California. Dear Sir:- Answering your letter of the 23rd inst. No. 14438/6-20 in regard to the Certificate of Wong Shoon Jung, which letter is herewith enclosed, will say that the writ of habeas corpus on Wong Quen Luck that you refer to was granted November 12, 1915, the No. of which is 15895 of habeas corpus proceedings in the District Court of the United States, northern district of California, W.B. Maling, Clerk, and the copy of the Discharge is No. 15895 and was entered November 17, 1915. Therefore, I do not see why you desire to hold the Certificate of Wong Shoon Jung and his boy has been disposed of and is here in Riverside, and the father naturally wants his papers. I have the original papers of discharge in the habeas corpus proceedings in my office, and if I am correct, please return the Certificate of Wong Shoon Jung to me, and oblige. Yours truly, P. 7.
