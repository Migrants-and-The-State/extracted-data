INSTRUCTIONS TO PHYSICIANS - MEDICAL CERTIFICATION. The statement of the cause of death, Item 19 in the Medical Certification, is designed to make it possible for the physician to indicate his judgment of the relationship of the causes to each other. Please enter in Part I (a) the immediate cause, that is, the disease or injury that directly caused death. The antecedent conditions which gave rise to the immediate cause should be entered on lines (b) and (c), the underlying cause, which initiated the train of events leading to death, being entered last. Each cause in Part I must have given rise to the cause on the line above it. If in your judgment the disease or injury entered in Item I (a) adequately describes the cause of death, no entries need be made in Items I (b) and I (c). Enter only one cause on a line. Enter in Part II any other significant condition which unfavorably influenced the course of the morbid process and thus contributed to the fatal outcome, but was not related to the disease or condition directly causing death. Write legibly or typewrite so that a local registrar, who in most cases is not a medically trained person, will be able to copy the medical certification in his official register correctly. If your signature is usually illegible, print or type your name under it. TO UNDERTAKERS - EXPLANATION OF SOME OF THE ITEMS IN THE DEATH CERTIFICATE. Item 1. Give the exact place and length of stay in the city, village, or town where the death occurred. If it occurred on a train or other common carrier, the name of the registration district where the body was removed from the common carrier should be entered as the place of death. Item 2. The city, village, or town where the deceased had his usual residence should be entered here regardless of how long he had resided in the community. Be sure to enter a check mark in one of the two boxes in Item 2-d. Quite often the post office address is a city or village, while the residence is outside the corporate limits of that city or village. In the latter case, the check mark should be entered in the box marked "no." The answer to Item 2-f should be based on the common understanding of what a farm is. Item 3. If the deceased was a married, divorced, or widowed woman, her own first name should be entered and not her husband's first name. Item 4. The actual date of death should be entered if it is definitely known. When a dead body is found, the entry should give the date when the body was found. Item 6. Color or race should be given as White, Negro, American Indian, Chinese, Japanese, etc. Expressions such as American, Irish, Italian should not be used. Item 10. The age of the deceased should agree with the date of birth in Item 9. Item 12. The entry in this item may be different from that in Item 11. For instance, if the deceased was born in Italy and was an American citizen by naturalization, the entry in Item 11 should be "Italy" and in Item 12, "United States." If, however, the deceased had not been naturalized, the entries in both Items 11 and 12 should be "Italy." Item 13. If the deceased changed his occupation shortly before death or if he had retired, the entry should state the kind of work done during most of his working life before the change or retirement. Item 16. An entry should always be made in the first space. If the deceased had at any time been in the U.S. Armed forces, the answer should be "yes"; the name of the war, or the years when he was in service should be written in the second space. If he had never been in military service or had served in the National Guard or some other State military organization when it was not federalized, the answer should be "no." Item 24a. Enter the name of the cemetery or crematory. Item 24b. Enter the address of the cemetery or crematory. Item 25a, 25b. The licensed and registered funeral director or undertaker who files this certificate must sign his own name and give his personal current Biennial Registration number and his address. Item 25c. Enter name of Funeral Establishment actually handling funeral. Include the current New York State Biennial Registration number of the establishment if it is licensed to operate in the State of New York. The certificate should be either typewritten or written legibly with durable black ink. If a mistake has been made in filling out any part of the form, the erroneous information must not be erased or the certificate altered. The certificate should be destroyed and a new one made.
