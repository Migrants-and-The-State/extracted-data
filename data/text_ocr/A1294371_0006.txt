4 INSTRUCTIONS TO THE APPLICANT Pages 1, 2, and 3 of this form must be completely filled out (preferably on the typewriter) Immigrant Identification Cards and Alien Registration Receipt Cards.-Every alien who entered the United States for permanent residence on the basis of an immigration visa on or after July 1, 1928, and prior to August 27, 1940, should be in possession of an immigrant identification card. Every alien in the United States should be in possession of an alien registration receipt card. You need not forward either card with this application. However, you will be required to present these cards when you appear to file your petition for naturalization and to surrender them at the time you are admitted to citizenship. You should therefore carefully save your immigrant identification card and your alien registration receipt card. Photographs.-You must send with this application three photographs of yourself taken within 30 days of the date of this appli- cation. These photographs must be 2 by 2 inches in size, and distance from top of head to point of chin should be approximately 1 1/4 inches, must not be pasted on a card or mounted in any other way, must be on thin paper, have a light background, and clearly show a front view of your face without hat. Each of these photographs must be signed by you on the margin and not on the face or clothing. Date of your arrival.-If you do not know the exact date of your arrival in the United States, or the name of the vessel or port, and you cannot obtain this information by consulting your family or friends who came over with you, give the facts of your arrival as you remember them in the appropriate blank spaces on the first page of this form. Your immigrant identification card or your passport, ship's card, or baggage labels, if you have them, may help you to answer these questions. If the date of your arrival in the United States was on or before June 29, 1906, you should submit with this application docu- mentary evidence of your residence in the United States prior to that date. Such documents may be family bible entries, deeds of record, wills or other authentic legal documents, life insurance policies, bankbooks and records, employment records or other documents showing that you entered the United States on or before June 29, 1906. Do not submit such documents if your arrival in the United States was after June 29, 1906, or if your declaration of intention (first paper) accompanies this application. Nationality and Race.-Nationality in statement No. 6, page 3, refers to the country of which you are a citizen or subject. Asto "race" in the same statement, Section 303 of the Nationality Act of 1940 provides that only white persons, persons of African nativity or descent, and descendants of races indigenous to the Western Hemisphere are eligible for naturalization. There are certain excep- tions, in the cases of native-born Filipinos who have served honorably in the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard for a period of at least 3 years, and in the cases of women who have lost United States citizenship through marriage. As stated above, the following races are eligible for naturalization: White. Indian. African or African descent. Eskimo. Filipino. Aleutian. State to which of these classifications you belong. WITNESSES.-The names, occupations, and addresses of two citizens you expect to bring with you as witnesses when you appear for examination to file your petition should be stated in items (17) and (18) on page 3. (These witnesses must have personal knowledge of your residence in the State where you now reside and have resided for the past 6 months, and of your character and other qualifications. A foreign-born witness must bring proof of his citizenship.) PENALTY FOR FALSELY SWEARING IN NATURALIZATION CASES It is a felony, punishable by a fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment for not more than 5 years, or both, for an alien or other person, whether an applicant for naturalization or citizenship, or otherwise, knowingly to make a false statement under oath, either orally or in writing, in any case, proceeding, or matter relating to, or under, or by virtue of any law of the United States relating to naturalization or citizenship.
