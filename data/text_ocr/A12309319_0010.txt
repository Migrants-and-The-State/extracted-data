SCHOOL SISTERS OF NOTRE DAME 220 East 4th Street NEW YORK 9, NEW YORK January 25, 1961 Dear Sir, The enclosed letter will answer your need, I hope. Your name was spelled with a "z" in our attendance book, but since all the information was the same as you had told me, I presumed it was correct. Please do not hesitate to write if there is anything fur- ther we can do. Sincerely, Sister m. Bertha
