U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IMMIGRATION SERVICE 14438/6-20. OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT. SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. July 15, 1915. Commissioner of Immigration, Thr8' Chinese Inspr. in Charge, Angel Island, Cal. In re WONG QUEN LUCK, Son of Native, Riverside, Cal., ex s/s KOREA, June 21, 1915: Statement of the applicant was taken, and the case was forwarded to Riverside for further investigation; it is now returned to me for final report. The case contains numerous material discrepancies: Alleged father states that his father died ST-3-10 in his house in China, and that his father and mother had been living in his house ever since he was married. Applicant states that his paternal grandfather dped CR-1; does not know where; that he never saw him, and that his mother told him about his grandfather's death. Applicant states that the witness, WONG BING JEW, came to his house and delivered some money in 1909, but he doesn't know how much. The witness states that he never at any time took any money to appli- cant's house, but that he had visited applicant's house. many times. The applicant, however, contradicts the latter statement, saying that the witness only called at his house once. Alleged father states that he never sent any money home by the witness. Applicant states that his father owns no land in China, while his alleged father states that he owns about 2 acres of rice land, in three pieces, and that his wife leases this land to other people. There are other minor discrepancies in the testimony, but the foregoing, in my opinion, are sufficient to warrant denial of the applicant, and I so recommend. WDH/PAM. SGD: W. D.
