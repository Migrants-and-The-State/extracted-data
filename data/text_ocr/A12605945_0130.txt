OFFICE OF THE SOLICITOR GENERA Washington, D. C. August 8, 1917. 179713-8. The Secretary of Labor. Sir : I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant (54005-52), with inclosures, relative to the advisability of attempting to bring before the United States Supreme Court, the judgment recently entered by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Edward White, Commissioner V. Wong Quen Luck. I have carefully examined the case, and find that the record is in such shape that even though a writ of certiorari could be obtained, it is not likely that a reversal of the judgment below could be brought about. It is unfortunate that a stenographic report of the entire proceedings in the trial court was not had in order that the record might show just what took place, and how far the Chinaman succeeded in es- tablishing his claim that he had not been accorded a fair hearing be cause a proper interpreter had not been supplied by the immi- gration officials. On the record as it stands it must be as- sumed that the Chinaman amply supported his contention, and in that situation a higher court, in the interest of justice, would hesitate to reverse the judgment entered in the case.
