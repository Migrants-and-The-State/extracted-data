A.Punsalangic Supervisor, Supervisor, HIV ELISA Unit Molecular Characterization Unit Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus associated with AIDS and is probably the cause of the immunodeficiency. Antibody tests can detect exposure to HIV-1, but cannot tests for AIDS or predict future development of AIDS or a related condition. The Department of Health's testing procedure includes initial screening with the ELISA method for all specimens and supplementary testing by the Western blot technique for some specimens (including all ELISA reactive specimens). Only samples reactive by both methods are currently considered to be positive. Samples that are nonreactive by the ELISA method are currently considered to be negative. Samples with inconsistent results that cannot be interpreted are reported as inconclusive. An additional blood sample is requested in such instances. 1084N (10/88)
