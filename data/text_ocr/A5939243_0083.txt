COUNSEL TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Mr. Willingham, all your previous arrests, outside of disturbing the peace, were always for drinking? A Yes. Q Haven't you been arrested for anything besides drinking? A No. Q And were all those arrests in West Los Angeles? A Yes. Q Have you ever been arrested here in Los Angeles proper? A No. BY COUNSEL: That's all. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO RESPONDENT: Q Do you have any comments to make on the testimony of either witness? Well, Mr. Willingham stated that he knew me for six years.

He just seen me before that, but I didn't know who he was. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q Is that correct-you saw him but you didn't know him? A Yes.
