February 8, 1977 To: Mr. William London INS Federal Building Miami, Fla. Re: File No. A-30-177-316 INL Application for Asylum for Maria Borrero Pierra. Dear Mr. London: My grandmother, Mrs. Borrero Pierra, can not come to your office as you requested. She is recovering from a bout with viral pneumonia, and is bed ridden for some time. She is 85 years old, partially deaf and partially blind. We might be able to bring her over in a wheel chair, but it will be difficult to do so in downtown Miami. Of course, we would like to see her status changed as soon as possible, from tourist to that of refugee, so we will do anything possible to help. Please let us know the best way to solve the interview problem, our family doctor beleives she may have to stay in bed for several weeks. Our telephone is 856-7913 in Miami, please ask for my mother Mrs. Martinez. Thank you in advance for for any assistance you may give us in this matter, sincerely, Steple Martin mastin. Stephen J. 1777 SW 17 st. Miami, Fla.
