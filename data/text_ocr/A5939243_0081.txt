Q Now on the statements that the Inspector read you purporting to be statements that you made voluntarily to Inspector Robert L. Tripp, you stated that you met Mrs. Paps two years ago for the first time at the Spanish Inn. This state- ment was made on October 10, 1944. Which is correct, that you met her six years ago or two years ago? A Well, it's been about six years ago that I saw her. Q In other wads, you were just guessing when you made the statement to Inspector Tripp that you had met her two years ago from October 10, 1944? A Yes. Q Now at the time you made the statements to Inspector Tripp wasn't it a fact the t previous to that, a few weeks or so, you had an altercation with Mr. Paps at his home in West Los Angeles? A Yes. Q And you were haled before a court in West Los Angeles on the charges of assault and battery--is that correct, Mr. Willingham? A Yes. Q And the statements that you gave to Inspe ctor Tripp regarding what Mrs. Paps told you as to her husband gambling, those were just figments of your imagin- ation inspired by your being sore at them for taking you to court--is that correct? A No. Q What made you say those statements to Inspector Tripp if they weren't true-- wasn't it because you were mad at the Paps? A Yes, sir. Q Have you ever seen Mr. Paps gamble? A No. Q Did Mr. Paps ever discuss horse racing with you? A No. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO WITNESS WILLINGHAM: Q You stated that you were called into court because of some trouble with Mr. Paps at his house? Yes, sir.
