Screened by NARA, 9/25/2023 of nationality, and that you were personally and voluntarily agreeing to a change in your status to that of a United States citizen. The first of the two forms N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exemption, that you submitted in support of your application was filled out by a physician who states that you examined you on only one occasion. This physician does not write how your medical problems have interfered with your attempts to learn the English language and American history and civics. This Service requested that you submit a second form N-648. The author of this second form writes only that you are creole-speaking. In view of the foregoing, it is determined that neither N-648 form makes the case for your exemption from the testing requirements given in section 312 of the Act as part of the naturalization application process. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, this application may not be approved and hereby is denied. No appeal lies from this decision. However, in accordance with 8 CFR 336.2(a), you may request a hearing before an immigration officer within thirty days of the date of this notice. To do so, you must fill out the attached form N-336 with the correct fee to this Service. Any questions that you have may be answered by the Service office nearest your residence, or at the address shown in the heading to this letter.
