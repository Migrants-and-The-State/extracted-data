1 the union that he belongs to, and he is in a position to have this 2 injury treated pursuant to this medical policy that he has. I further 3 understand from Mr. Beeks that he would not have sufficient funds 4 in British Honduras nor the means by which to seek and obtain 5 treatment for the injury in British Honduras and for that reason we 6 make this motion that the hearing be deferred or continued until in 7 such time Mr. Beeks has concluded either by filing or having a 8 determination made of any claim that he might have under workman's 9 compensation or in any event until such time as he has completed 10 his treatment for the injury. 11 THE SPECIAL INQUIRY OFFICER: 12 Mr. Cohen I must deny your motion, I find no merit to your request, 13 this is something entirely collateral to the issue deportability, the 14 purpose of this hearing is to determine his deportability and what 15 you have brought up is something entirely outside of the issues of 16 this case. Now, how does he plead to the five allegations? 17 MR. COHEN: 18 He admits each of the allegations. 19 THE SPECIAL INQUIRY OFFICER: 20 And how does he plead to the charge of deportability? 21 MR. COHEN: 22 He admits deportability. 23 THE SPECIAL INQUIRY OFFICER: 24 Is he applying for any form of discretionary relief? 25 MR. COHEN : 26 Yes he is, voluntary departure.
