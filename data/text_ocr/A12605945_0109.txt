C.R. 7-1-19 (March 1, 1918). Dear Father : The letter and the $100.00 Mex. you sent home on the last month of last year (Jan., 1918) were received and given to mother for the household expenses. Mother has engaged Lim Soon Suey's daughter to be brother Koon Lock's wife. This girl is 19 years old, belonging to Ai Long Bo, Hung Ock Village. On the night of the 8th last (Feb. 18, 1918) there suddenly came to their village a large number of robbers, robbing everything in the village. Lim Soon Suey then beat the gong calling out for help, and he was shot to death by the robbers. On account of that his wife became sorrowful, and we hear she is getting worse from day to day; perhaps this will cause her death. If she should die, her daughter, having no relatives to depend upon, would have no place to go and no one to support her. So, we are writing you hoping you will send brother Koon Lock home at once to get married in order that mother may be comforted. When you receive this letter, please write us and tell us what to do, so that mother may not be anxious about it. Your daughter, Ah Ngon. Lee Shee (the wife). (Translation of Chinese writings on Chinese envelope): Please give it to father Wong Siu Kay, Riverside, (Cal.), U.S.A. Sent by Ngon from Wo Hing Village, Sun Ning District. Translated by Interpreter H. K. Tang, July 11, 1918.
