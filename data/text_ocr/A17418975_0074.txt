November 20, 1968 A-17 418 975 IFR Mr. Nicolas Guardiola 2608 Anderson Road Coral Gables, Florida 33134 Dear Sir: This is in reference to your letter of October 25, 1968, advising this office that you were a permanent resident of this country and left for Cuba in 1960 and could not return until August 1,1967. You inquire if your permanent residency status could be restored to you or what you could do to become a legal resident again. As you remained outside of the United States for over a period of one year, you lost your permanent resident status. If you wish to become a legal resident of this country, you can wait until August 1, 1969, and apply under Public Law 89-732, which allows Cuban Refugees who have resided in the United States for two years to file applications to become permanent residents. If you do not want to wait until that time, you may file an application for a permanent resident visa at a United States Consulate abroad at the present time. We trust that the above information will be of assistance to you. Yours very truly, District Director By: but C. G. Yeager Deputy District Director RF
