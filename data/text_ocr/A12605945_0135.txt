54005/52 --2-- gradually to lay down rules for the guidance of administrative officers which are based upon judicial ideas and judicial methods to such an extent as seriously to hamper the administrative branch in performance of the functions which Con- gress has imposed upon it. There seems to be a marked tendency in the courts, especially of late, to fail to distinguish between the conducting of an unfair administrative hearing or the arbitrary exercise of authority by administra- tive officers, and the weighing of evidence in administrative proceedings by the officers charged with the conduct thereof, and the Department trusts that it may be possible, either in this case or in some other case selected by your Department at an early date, to carry this entire matter before the Supreme Court in such a way 0.8 to obtain a decision that will settle it once for all. The Department had thought at one time that all of those questions had been disposed of by the leading decisions of the Supreme Court in Chinese and immigration cases; but the Lower Courts seem to be using the power, which undoubtedly they have, to overrule administrative decisions on the ground that they are based on unfair hearings or are arbitrary as a means of substituting their judgment for the judgment of the officers charged by law with the deci- sion of the questions involved in the application to concrete cases of the im- migration and Chinese statutes, and, as above indicated, this situation is made all the more serious by the attempt of the courts to lay down rules for the con- duct of the cases that are calculated merely to hamper the administrative branch in the performance of its duties.
