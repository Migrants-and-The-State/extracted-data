This individuel case was declined by the U. S. Attorney. Mr Bates Possible prosecution was closed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service under 8 CFR 287.2 without presentation to the U.S. Attorney because: There has been no violation. The Statute of Limitations has run. The subject's failure to register as required by Section 262(a) of the I & N Act was not wilful and the subject has now complied with that Section. The subject's failure to give notice of address as required by Section 265 of the I & N Act was uninentional or due to ignorance and the subject has now complied with that Section. The alien's failure to have in his personal possession Alien Registration Receipt Card or Certification of Alien Registration Ã s required under Section 264(e) of the I & N Act was unintentional or due to ignorance. Prosecution under Section 264(e) of the Act is not warranted. The subject represented himself as a USC solely for the purpose of obtaining employment which he could or would have obtained even though he had fully disclosed his true nationality and status. This case is within a class declared, in writing, by the appropriate U. S. Attorney to be unworthly of consideration. It therefore appears that criminal prosecution is not warranted and the case should be closed pursuant to 0.1. 287, paragraph 13. Declined by the U.S. Attorney on blanket or general waiver.
