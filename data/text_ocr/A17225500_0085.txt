INSTRUCTIONS 1. Fees. This notice of appeal must be accompanied by the prescribed fees: for appeal from a decision in an exclusion or deportation proceeding $50; for an appeal from any other decision $25. (Only a single fee need be paid if two or more persons are covered by a single decision.) Attach money order or check, payable to the "Immigration and Naturalization Service, Department of Justice." Do NOT send cash. If this form is filed in Guam, make remittance payable to the "Treasurer, Guam;" if filed in the Virgin Islands, make remittance payable to "Commissioner of Finance of the Virgin Islands." The fee is required for filing the appeal and is not returnable regardless of the action taken thereon. 2. Counsel. In presenting and prosecuting this appeal the appellant may, if he desires, be represented at no expense to the Government by counsel or other duly authorized representatives. 3. Briefs. A brief in support of or in opposition to an appeal is not required, but if a brief is filed it shall be in triplicate and submitted to the officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service having adminis- trative jurisdiction over the case within the time fixed for the appeal or within any other additional period designated by the special inquiry officer or other Service officer who made the decision. Such officer, or the Board for good cause, may extend the time for filing a brief or reply brief. The Board in its discretion may authorize the filing of briefs directly with it, in which event the opposing party shall be allowed a specified time to respond. 4. Oral argument. Oral argument in any one case should not extend beyond fifteen (15) minutes, unless arrangements for additional time are made with the Board in advance of the hearing. An appellant will not be released from detention or permitted to enter the United States to present oral argument to the Board but may make arrangements to have someone represent him before the Board, and unless such arrangements are made at the time the appeal is taken, the Board will not calendar the case for argument. 5. Summary dismissal of appeals. The Board may deny oral argument and summarily dismiss any appeal in any deportation proceeding in which (i) the party concerned fails to specify the reason for his appeal on the reverse side of this form, (ii) the only reason specified by the party concerned for his Appeal involves a finding of fact or conclusion of law which was conceded by him at the hearing, or (iii) the appeal if from an order that grants the party concerned the relief which he requested. 6. Filing of Notice of Appeal. The Notice of Appeal, in triplicate, with the required fee, must be submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service office where the case is pending. The Notice of Appeal is not to be forwarded directly to the Board of Immigration Appeals.
