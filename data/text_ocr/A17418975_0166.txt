PURPOSE OF REENTRY PERMIT This permit shall have no effect under the immigration laws, except to show that said alien is returning from a temporary visit abroad; nor shall it be construed to be the exclusive means of establishing that the alien is so returning. The possession of in unexpired permit to reenter the United States relieves the alien to whom it is issued from the necessity of securing a visa from an American consul before returning to this country. It does not, however, relieve the person to whom the permit is issued from meeting all other requirements of the immigration laws. PERMIT NO ASSURANCE AGAINST EXCLUSION Persons who have been convicted of or admit having committed a felony or other crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpi- tude either before or after entering the United States, other criminals, immoral, insane, mentally or physically defective aliens, those afflicted with loathsome or contagious diseases, and others found to be inadmissible under the immigration laws are subject to exclusion if attempting to reenter, notwithstanding they may be in possession of reentry permits. EFFECT OF ABSENCE FROM THE UNITED STATES UPON NATURALIZATION ELIGIBILITY The law provides, among other things, "Absence from the United States for a continuous period of more than six months and less than one year during the period for which continuous residence is required for admission to citizenship, immediately pre- ceding the date of filing the petition for naturalization, or during the period between the date of filing the petition and the date of final hearing, shall be presumed to break the continuity of such residence, but such presumption may be overcome by the presenta- tion to the naturalization court of satisfactory evidence that such individual had a reasonable cause for not returning to the United States during such absence. Absence from the United States for a continuous period of one year or more during the period for which continuous residence is required for admission to citizenship immediately preceding the date of filing the petition for natu- ralization or during the period between the date of filing the petition and the date of final hearing, shall break the continuity of such residence, except that in the case of an alien "(a) Who has been lawfully admitted into the United States for permanent residence; "(b) Who has resided in the United States for at least one year thereafter; and "(c) Who has made a declaration of intention to become a citizen of the United States, who shall be deemed an eligible alien for the purposes of this paragraph and who thereafter has been sent abroad as an employee of, or under contract with, the Government of the United States, or who thereafter proceeded abroad as an employee or representative of, or under con- tract with, an American institution of research recognized as such by the Attorney General, or as an employee of a firm or corpo- ration engaged in the development of foreign trade and commerce of the United States, or a subsidiary thereof, or any such eligible alien as above defined who has proceeded abroad temporarily and has within a period of one year of his departure from the United States become an employee or representative of, or who is under contract with, such an American institution of research, or has become an employee of such an American firm or corporation, no such absence shall break the continuity of residence in the United States if "(1) Prior to the beginning of such absence, or prior to the beginning of such employment, contract. or representation on behalf of an American institution of research or an American firm or corporation as aforesaid, such alien has established to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that his absence for such period is to be on behalf of such Government or for the purpose of carrying on scientific research on behalf of such institution, or to be engaged solely or principally in the development of such for- eign trade and commerce, or whose residence abroad is necessary to the protection of the property rights abroad of such firm or corporation; and "(2) Such alien proves to the satisfaction of the court that his absence from the United States for such period has been for such purpose. "An alien who has been lawfully admitted into the United States for permanent residence, and who is the wife or husband of a citizen of the United States so engaged abroad within one of the above-mentioned categories, shall be considered as residing in the United States for the purpose of naturalization notwithstanding any absence from the United States." If you are going abroad for the purpose indicated above, you should forward an application on Form 2363, "Application for the Benefits of the Act of June 25, 1936 (49 Stat. 1925), as amended." PENALTY FOR FALSE STATEMENTS The following provision of law prescribes the penalty for making false statements in a reentry permit proceeding: "Whoever knowingly makes under oath any false statement in any application, affidavit, or other document required by the immigration laws or regulations prescribed thereunder, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000, or impris- oned for not more than five years, or both."
