Screened by NARA, 9/14/2022 Attachment(s) to Form N-335 Applicant: Eliacine Valeur Application for Naturalization, Form N-400 Alien Number: A39 051 490 Application ID: EAC 9702950695 Reference is made to your Application for Naturalization, Form N-400, which you filed on November 12, 1996, pursuant to Section 316 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Under Section 312 of the INA and Title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 312, an applicant for naturalization must demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the English language and United States history and government. However, section 312(b) of the INA provides that the English and civics requirements "shall not apply to any person who is unable because of physical or developmental disability or mental impairment to comply therewith." To qualify for an exception under section 312(b), an applicant must establish that he or she has a "medically determinable" physical or developmental disability or mental impairment. "Medically determinable" means that the disability or impairment, or combination thereof "results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which can be shown by medically acceptable clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques to have resulted in functioning SO impaired as to render an individual unable to demonstrate an understanding" of English and/or U.S. history and government. The record reflects that you submitted a Form N-648, Medical Certification for Disability Exception, on April 28, 1997. On November 14, 2001, the adjudicating officer reviewed your N- 648 and determined that it was not acceptable to establish that you were eligible for an exception from the section 312 requirements. Specifically, the N-648 did not contain a detailed explanation of your disability(ies with appropriate DSM codes, or an explanation of the connection or nexus between your disability(ies) and your inability to demonstrate a knowledge of English and civics. On November 14, 2001 the adjudicating officer requested, as an attachment to Form N-14, that you submit by December 14, 2001, an amended or second N-648 correcting the noted deficiencies. To date, an amended N-648 has not been received. On April 28, 1997 and on May 26, 2004, you were tested on your knowledge of English and United States history and government (civics). You failed to pass these examinations. As a result, you have failed to meet the requirements of Section 312 and are ineligible for naturalization.
