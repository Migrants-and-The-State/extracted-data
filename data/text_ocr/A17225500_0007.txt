A17 225 500 The respondent requested a continuance of the de- portation proceedings to allow him to file a claim for workmen's compensation benefits arising out of an injury at his employment and to further defer hearings until a determination is made on his claim and until such time as he has completed his treatment for the injury. We find no error in the decision of the special inquiry officer denying the respondent's motion for a continuance for an indefinite period. The decision on whether to grant voluntary departure and the time within which the alien should be permitted to depart voluntarily are matters within the discretion of the adjudicating offi- cer. In granting voluntary departure within 30 days, the special inquiry officer extended the maximum relief for which the respondent is eligible. Under 8 C.F.R. 244.2, further time within which to depart voluntarily is within the sole discretion of the District Director. ORDER: It is ordered that the appeal be and the same is hereby dismissed. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to the special inquiry officer's order, the respondent be permitted to depart from the United States voluntarily within 31 days from the date of this decision or any extension beyond that time as may be granted by the District Director; and that, in the event of the failure so to depart, the respondent shall be deported as provided in the special inquiry officer's order.
