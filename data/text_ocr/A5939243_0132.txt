West Los Angeles, California 18th July, 1944 To whom it may concern: This is to certify that the undersigned, Elizabeth Handelsman, a housewife, has the following statements to make in regards to her relationship to Philip M. Paps. I was born March 13, 1900 at Singapore, Strait Settlements. After the death of my father, my mother married Mitchell John Paps at Singapore. Upon completing the contract on which he was employ- ed my step-father and our family moved to the Philippine Islands and settled in the town of Davao, on the Island of Mindanao, where my half-brother, Philip was born on July 20, 1908. I, as well as the rest of our family always labored under the impression that my step-father was registered as a British subject although he was a Greek by birth. In 1928 or thereabout, while I was residing in the town of Legaspi, Province of Albay, Philippine Islands, Philip left for the United States as an employee aboard an American freighter, and to the best of my knowledge and belief settled in New Orleans, Louisiana. When my half-sister, Ellie who is Philip's full sister came to California from the Philippines, Philip came to Los Angeles to visit her and remained there until the present time. Anything else pertaining to Philip I am ignorant of. I know that he is my half-brother, and that the same mother brought us both into this world, and that Philip has a brother and sister living here in Los Angeles, and also our mother, a sister and a brother in Manila Exhibit Case of No Jule16543/2238
