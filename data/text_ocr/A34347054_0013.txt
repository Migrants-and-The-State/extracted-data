Under the Paperwork Reduction Act, a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it dispays a currently valid OMB number. We try to create forms and instructions that are accurate, can be easily understood, and which impose the least possible burder on you to provide us with information. Often this is difficult because some immigration laws are very complex. Accordingly. the reporting burden for this collection of information is computed as follows: 1)Learning about the law and form 3 minutes 2) completing form 2 minutes and 3) Assembling and filing the application 5 minutes; for a total estimated average of 10 minutes per response. If you have comments regarding the accuracy of this estimate, or suggestions for making this form simpler, you can WRITE to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, N.W.; Room 53C7. Washington, D.C. 20536. (Do not mail your completed application to this address.) Part 2.
