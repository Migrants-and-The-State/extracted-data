no certified copy of the record pertaining to his divorce from his first wife. However, since it appears that it is impossible to obtain such record from the Philippine Islands, and since respondent has presented some evidence in the form of affidavits, it is believed reasonable to concede that this marriage was legally terminated. Respondent's present wife was formerly married in 1925 or 1926, which marriage terminated in divorce on November 14, 1929 (p. 22 and Ex. 26). Respondent's wife testified that while her husband was in the Service she twice went to live with another man, one J. D. Willingham, but that in May, 1944, after her husband's discharge from the Service she returned to him and has lived with him continuously since that date. She further testified that it was her suggestion that she return to her husband (pp. 24-27). The above mentioned Mr. Willingham stated to the Inspector who conducted the independent investigation in this case that Mrs. Paps stated to him that her only reason for returning to the respondent was to help him adjust his immigration status (Ex. 24). Mr. Willingham, however, when called to testify at the hearing, stated that he did not remember res- pondent's wife having made such a statement to him and that he gave such information because "I guess I was just mad because she (Mrs. Paps) went back" (p. 41-43) Respondent's wife states that she is at present living with her husband and that she is entirely dependent upon him for support (pp. 31, 36). Respondent is employed and earns approximately $200 per month (I-55, P. 8). Respondent's wife testified that she suffers from anemia and heart trouble and is under a doctor's care (p. 30 & Ex. 22). Respondent also presented a letter from his wife s doctor indicating that she is under doctor's care (Ex. 25). Respondent's wife further testified that she was first unable to work in July, 1944, and that her doctor has told her that she will not be able to work again. She stated that for that reason her husband's deportation would result in serious economic detriment to her (p. 29). It is found that deportation of the respondent would result in serious economic detriment to his citizen wife. Respondent testified that he has never been arrested abroad and that his only arrests in the United States were by the Immigration Service in 1936 and in 1943 at the beginning of the present proceeding (I-55, p. 10). Report of the independent investigation conducted by the office of this Service in Detroit, where the respondent resided prior to his residence in Los Angeles indicates that he is a person of good moral character and that that office was unable to find any police or welfare record pertaining to him (Ex, 23). An independent investigation was conducted by an Inspector of the Los Angeles Office of this Service (Ex. 24), Several people, including respondent's present and former employers, were interviewed during the course of the investigation. All of them, with the exception of one person, recommended the res- pondent as a person of good moral character. The one exception, Mr. J. D. Willingham, mentioned earlier in this opinion, gave a great deal - 6 -
