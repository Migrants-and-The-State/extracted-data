Non Reactive Antibody to HIV-1 & 2 (ELISA) Non Reactive Interpretation : 1. A NON REACTIVE result implies that no Anti HIV-1 or Anti HIV-2 antibodies have been detected in the sample by this method. This means that either the patient has not been exposed to HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection or the sample has been tested during the "WINDOW PHASE" ( before the development of detectable levels of antibodies). 2. A PROVISIONALLY REACTIVE / BORDERLINE REACTIVE result suggests the possibility of HIV-1 or/and HIV-2 infection. However these results must be verified by a confirmatory WESTERN BLOT-1-2 test before pronouncing the patient positive for HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 infection. 3. Please Note that very high levels of IgM Antibodies or Anti-HLA ABC and DR Antibodies can give false positive reactions.
