Craig May 15, 1997 t Also Admitted in NJ * Also Admitted in FL U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 130 Delaware Avenue Buffalo, New York 14202 Re: Naturalization of Julian Beresniewicz Dear Sir or Madam: We are attorneys for Mr. Julian Beresniewicz, and should have a G-28 form on file with you. Enclosed please find a completed N-400 form, along with two photographs and a money order for $95. As Mr. Beresniewicz is 91 years of age, no finger prints have been included with the application. Mr. Beresniewicz does not speak the English language, and we request his exemption from any examinations during or after his naturalization interview. Also, due to his poor health, we request that, if possible, Mr. Beresniewicz be exempted from the naturalization interview altogether or that an alternative interview be arranged in Rochester, New York. Please advise us if there is any possibility of making such arrangements. Mr. Beresniewicz plans to travel to Poland, health permitting, for an extended stay with family once his naturalization is complete. Although we are aware that naturalization applications are processed on a first-come first-serve basis, we request that if an interview is required for Mr. Beresniewicz, that it be scheduled on the earliest possible date. Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this application and to advise us on approximate processing time. Thank you. Very truly yours, KNAUF & CRAIG, LLP MAA MARK A.
