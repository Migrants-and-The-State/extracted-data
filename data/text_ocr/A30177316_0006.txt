August 1, 1978 MEMORANDUM TO THE FILE: SUBJECT: Maria Mercedes BORRERO-Pierre, A30 177 316 Per letter of February 17, 1977 by C.I. London, subject's relative was notified political asylum was pending. Form I-94 was furnished showing such action. Form I-213 dated June 1, 1978, indicates subject desires to return to Cuba voluntarily at her own expense with the full consent of her family. Since subject is 86 years old and perhaps would need a travel companion, it is considered inappropriate for this section to attempt further action towards deportation. Daniel L.
