5.- No.14438/6-20. page 6 Bureau file, "Applicant sworn and admonished to state if he fails to understand the interpreter, speaks See Yip, interpreter's original dialect," - and held in the face not only of its own line of decisions, but that of the Supreme Court, that the lover court had any authority to find that the hearing given the applicant by the Immigration officers was unfair on the ground that the applicant did not understand the dislect spoken by the interpretor. In the understanding of this office, if there is anything that has been established by the courts in habeas corpus proceedings invilining orders of exclusion or expulsion of aliens made by the immigration officials, it is thought that when the immigration record before the court contains evidence like this upon its face,and contains nothing to the contrary, the court must "keep its hands off." -Further- more the court evidently failed to consider that there is nothing in the petition even remotely suggesting that there was unfairness in the hear- ing because of the dialect spoken by the interpreter. In fact, from everything that was before the court it appears that the matter oil dialect was injected into the case for the first time during the progress of final the hearing in the District Court, the Government never having been apprised that such a question would be raised, and thus not being afforded an opportunity to meet the claim of the petitioner by having the interpreter available to take the stand.
