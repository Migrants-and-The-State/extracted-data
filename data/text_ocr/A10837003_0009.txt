Dear Sir;- I wish to have some information in my case. I came to the States on a Refugee Relief Act and I am not happy and satisfied with my work and place where I am at present, could I leave my sponsor in case if I get another job in another town or state? To better my future I have a chance to have another p osition in another state and I would appreciate if you could tell me if it could be done and what should be done. Awaiting your kind reply, I thank you in anticipation. Very truly yours, Lucha Heidt Lucia Heidt. (Mrs). 12 CW 1880 T.C. 4-1-57 - all
