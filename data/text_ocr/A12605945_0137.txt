U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IMMIGRATION SERVICE OFFICE OF THE COMMISSIONER SAN FRANCISCO, CAL. 14438/6-20 July 24, 1917. Commissioner-General of Immigration, Washington, D. C. Enclosed will be found a copy of an opinion recently filed by the Circuit Court of Appeals of this Circuit in the case of Wong Quen Luck, holding that the District Court (Judge Dooling) committed no error in deciding that the Immigration hearing was unfair, but that that court went further than it should have gone in discharging the applicant unconditionally. Also enclosed are the following: a printed cow of the transcript of the court record on appeal; respondent's exhibit "3" in the case, the same being the original record of the Bureau of the proceedings before this office and the Department; a printed copy of the Government's brief, and a supplemental file of the Bureau in the case, which was sent to this office, no doubt inadvertently,when the said original Bureau record was returned to this office with the advice that the Depart- ment desired that anappeal be taken from the decision of the District Court. The proceedings in the District Court are reported in my original letter of November 22, 1915 contained in the said supplemental Bureau file enclosed.
