tially the same information as follows: They have known the subject since he was a baby and have seen him frequently since he moved to Los Angeles from Detroit about three years ago. He has lived in the courts at the captioned address for about fifteen months. The subject is a man of good moral character, does not get drunk or have any bad habits that the witnesses know of. The only trouble in which the subject was ever involved was when a Mr. Dillingham or Willingham came to the courts and started a fight with the subject. It seems that the subject's wife had started to run around with this man while the subject was in the Coast Guard and even after he was discharged she is supposed to have gone away with this man and stayed for four or five months. The trouble at the courts resulted when this Willingham came to Pap's house and started a fight. The subject filed a complaint against Willingham who was arrested and brought to trial in Los Angeles. This Willingham has a poor reputa- tion in this community and is quite a drunkard. The witness said that the subject is a steady worker and a good provider, and that other than the trouble with Willingham, he and his wife have always lead a happy home life. Mrs. Paps worked quite regularly as a waitress until recently when she quit her job on doctor's orders because of heart trouble. The subject is completely loyal and would make a good citizen of the United States. On September 22, 1944, Mrs. Madge R. Dickerson, who lives in this same court at apartment number 1259, was interviewed and verified the sub- ject's residence as claimed. She said that Mr. Paps is a fine neighbor and a very quiet person. She has never seen him drunk or disorderly and considers him to be a decent sort of man. This witness also told of Mrs. Paps' having run away with a man named Willingham but said that she returned to live with the subject about two months ago. At the present time Mrs. Paps is not living with her husband but is staying with his sister and her husband in Tarzana so that she can rest up. She has been very ill and under a doctor's care. Mrs. Dickerson said that the subject and his wife are definitely reconciled and that Mrs. Paps told her she would like to return to her husband soon as she is much happier here in the court. She also told Mrs. Dickerson that she would have left Willingham long before she did, but that she was ashamed of having run off with him and couldn't face her husband. This witness said that she considers the sub- ject to be very loyal to the United States and that after he was discharged from the Coast Guard he told her he would give anything to get back into the Service.
