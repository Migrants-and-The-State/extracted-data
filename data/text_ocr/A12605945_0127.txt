14438/6-20 of Appeals' judgment, and would, it seems, have forced an abandonment of the review proceeding before a decision thereon could have been ob- tained, especially in the event that the rehearing resulted in the landing of the applicant. It is noted from the copy of the Solicitor-General's let- ter to the Secretary of Labor dated August 8, 1917, referred to this office by the Bureau, that the Solicitor-General considered it un- fortunate that of stenographic report of the proceeding in the District Court was not had. Inasmuch as the Solicitor General's letter in the matter to the United States Attorney does not clearly bring out the importance attached to this omission, the first-mentioned letter is being quoted to the United States Attorney, his attention being called particularly to this point in the hope that the service of a stenographer will be insisted upon in future cases. It is noted that while the Solicitor-General returned to the Bureau its file in the case, the Bureau did not send 1t to this office with the said copy of the Solicitor-General's letter. The file may be retained by the Bureau if in its possession, as it seems that the case must now be considered as closed. Should it later arrive here however it will be returned to the Bureau.
