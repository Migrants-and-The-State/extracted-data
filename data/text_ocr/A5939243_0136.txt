-3- Philip Paps was always very anxious to become an American Citizen and I am personally convinced that this desire was true and sincere, and I can cheerfully recommend him for citizenship/ He is, and has been employed steadily since his arrival in the United States. His service in the armed forces of the United States and his honorable discharge therefrom is also evidence of his sincerity. Respectfully yours, John J. JOHN J.
