Makris 232 Orient Way Lyndhurst, New Jersey Dear Sir: Reference is made to your recent correspondence regarding your eligibility to file a petition for naturalization.

You may if you wish resubmit your application on or after March 22, 1966. Sincerely, Dominick F Rinaldi District Director wl file 4-7-65 wl
