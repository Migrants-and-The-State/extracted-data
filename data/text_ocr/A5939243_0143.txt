was interviewed and verified the subject's employment from August, 1943, to the present time. She said that he is a steady, reliable employee, a willing worker and a valuable man in the organization. He is now paid $200 a month, but it is expected that his wages will be increased soon because he is taking on new responsibilities in the shop and will assume the title of service salesman. ADDITIONAL INTERVIEWS Mrs. Dora Paps, the subject's wife, was interviewed on September 5, 1944 in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Miller, 5210 Reseda Blvd., Tarzana, Cali- fornia. Mr. and Mrs. Miller are the brother-in-law and sister of the sub- ject. Mrs. Paps made the following statement: She is staying at this ad- dress temporarily so that she can rest up following her recent illness. She has had a heart ailment and nervous disorders and is still under a doctor's care. Mrs. Paps was questioned concerning the present status of her marital relationship and stated that she and her husband are reconciled and have resumed living together, although temporarily she is staying with Mr. and Mrs. Miller so she can have care and rest. Mrs. Paps admitted that while her husband was on duty in the Coast Guard she had met Mr. Willingham and started going around with him. They met in the Spanish Inn in West Los Angeles where she was a waitress and he was a frequent customer. She stated that in March, 1944, she left her husband and lived with Willingham for about three months returning to her husband in May, 1944. She said that she lived with Willingham at 413 East 7th Street, Los Angeles. Mrs. Paps gave no reason for leaving the subject other than that she "lost her head and did this crazy thing." She said that the subject has always treated her well during their twelve years of married life and that he had done nothing to cause her to leave him. He works steadily and has always supported her and she contended that she worked only to keep herself occupied and earn a little money for extras. She stated that she has not seen Willingham since he came to their house last July and started a fight with her husband and declared that she intends to have nothing more to do with Willingham, but that she expects to continue living with her husband. On September 13, 1944, Mr. J. D. Willingham, previously identified as the man with whom the subject's wife lived in Los Angeles, was interviewed. This witness said that he is presently residing at 911 South Maple Avenue, Los Angeles but that his permanent address is with his parents at 1739 Corinth Avenue, West Los Angeles. Concerning his relationship with the subject's wife, Mr. Willingham gave the following information: He first met Mrs. Paps about two years ago at the Spanish Inn in West Los Angeles where she was working as a waitress. They started running around together but she continued to live with her husband until he went into the United States Coast Guard. The witness continued to see Mrs. Paps and then one day she asked him if he would accompany her to New Orleans, saying that she wanted to visit her relatives in that city. She said that she would withdraw some money from her bank account for their trip to New Orleans and pay both of their expenses if he would go with her. They made the trip together and took a room in that city in the same house with her sisters, with whom she was visiting. One day the witness learned that Mr. Paps was in New Orleans and that he had come to take his wife home, so the witness left town and returned to Los Angeles alone. About one year ago Mrs. Paps left her husband and came to Los Angeles where she rented a room at the Alomah Hotel, 640 South 16542/2238 -3- 10/10/44
