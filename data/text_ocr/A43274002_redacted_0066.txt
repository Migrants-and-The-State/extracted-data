Non Reactive Antibody to HIV-I & II (ELISA) Non Reactive Interpretation I. A NON REACTIVE result implies that no Anti HIV-I or Anti HIV-II antibodies have been detected in the sample by this method. This means that either the patient has not been exposed to HIV-I or HIV-II infection or the sample has been tested during the 'WINDOW PHASE" ( before the development of detectable levels of antibodies). 2. A PROVISIONALLY REACTIVE / BORDERL INE REACTIVE result suggests the possibility of HIV-I or /and HIV-II infection. However these results must be verified by a confirmatory WESTERN BLOT-I-I] test before pronouncing the patient positive for HIV-> and/or HIV-II infection. 3. Please Note that very high levels of IgM Antibodies or Anti-HLA ABC and DR Antibodies can give false positive reactions.
