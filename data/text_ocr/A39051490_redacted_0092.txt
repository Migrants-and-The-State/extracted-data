The Social Security Act, as amended, establishes certain requirements for determining the eligibility of aliens for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits. These amendments require that the income and resources of any person who as the sponsor of an alien's entry into the United States, executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement on behalf of the alien, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the income and resources of the alien under formulas for determining eligibility for SSI benefits during the three years following the alien's entry into the United States. The eligibility of aliens for SSI will be contingent upon their obtaining the cooperation of their sponsors in providing the necessary information and evidence to enable the Social Security Administration to carry out this provision. An alien applying for SSI must make available to Social Security Administration will be provided in support of his application for an immigrant visa or any documentation concerning his income or resources or those of his sponsors to adjustment of status. The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized obtain copies of any such documentation from other agencies. The Social Security Act also provides that an alien and his or her sponsors shall be jointly and severably liable to repay any SSI benefits which are incorrectly paid because of misinformation provided by sponsors or because of sponsors failure to provide information, and any incorrect payments which are not repaid will be withheld from any subsequent payments for which the alien or sponsors otherwise eligible under the Social Security Act. These provisions do not apply to an alien who becomes blind or disabled after entry into the United States.
