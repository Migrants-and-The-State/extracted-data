EFFECT, UNDER IMMIGRATION LAWS, OF PERMIT 1 REENTER This permit shall have no effect under the. immigration laws, except to show that said alien is returning from a temporary visit abroad; nor shall it be construed to be the exclusive means of establishing that the alien is so returning, The possession of an unexpired permit to reenter the United States relieves the alien to whom it is issued from the necessity of securing a visa from an American consul before returning to this country. It does not, however, relieve the person to whom the permit is issued from meeting all other require- ments of the immigration laws.
