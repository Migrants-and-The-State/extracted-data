THE FOREIGN SERVICE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ADDRESS OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS TO American Consulate General Hong Kong, August 27, 1953 District Director, Immigration and Naturalization Service, San Francisco, California. Ref: File 221 - WONG Yeow Hong, et al., , alleged sons of WONG Quen Luck. Dear Sir: Reference is made to our letter of June 19, 1950, enclosing summary of testimony, affidavits, and a group photograph in connection with this case, and requesting a summary of pertinent records together with the recommendations of your office. The Consulate General has no record of the receipt of a reply to this letter, However, it has received from your office a summary of your files in connection with the case of WONG Fay Yee, alleged brother of WONG Yeow Hong. This summary was forwarded to us at the request of the Los Angeles office of your service in connection with a request we made of them on September 9, 1952. Your letter of May 21, 1953, enclosing the summary, appears to answer our earlier enquiry. However, the Consulate General would appreciate the return of the enclosures to its original letter, particularly the photograph which appears to have been a composite. Very truly yours, 1223 It bN s to S. M. Backe CAR CVFIE American Consul n'2' DEbI OE INSTICE IWW.8 NAT RACE (D'D')
