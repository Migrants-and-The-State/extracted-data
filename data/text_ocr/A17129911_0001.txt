A17 129 911 January 20, 1967 Mr. Max Carl 7069 Delmar Blvd. University City, Missouri Dear Sir: With reference to your pending application for certificate of citizenship, we wish to advise that we are unable to verify the record of your arrival in the United States. We have checked the arrival records for the year 1901 and we have also checked the record of naturalization of your father, Jacob Carl, in an effort to locate the record of your entry. If you can do so, kindly furnish some documentary evidence which would establish your presence in this country before June 29, 1906. Also, if you will furnish the certificate number on the certificate of your sister, Annie C. Markovsky, the date of issuance and the place of issuance of her certificate, we will arrange for an inspection of that record. Very truly yours, PRIMUS F. MAJDA Officer in Charge mjb 1-23-67- tvVC again (Halemi) Try under name Krolor Knall_ about 1904-
