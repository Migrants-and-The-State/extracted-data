424 GUY STREET MONTREAL 3, P. QUE. TEL. WE. 5-2605 Thibault Fine Arts REG'D JA July 13th., 1965 TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN This letter will serve to introduce Mr. William Alexander, Canadian citizen, resident of Brossard, Quebec. I have known Mr. Alexander as a personal friend and associate artist for the past twelve (12) years. We are thinking of opening a Picture Frame business for Fine Arts, Mr. Alexander is going to make a survey in the United States of America to see exactly what the potential is and whether our new style frames will be accepted. He will be carrying various samples of our frames with him. Yours very truly, W.E. Thibault
