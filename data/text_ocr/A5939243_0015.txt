married Philippine citizens and who might be lawfully naturalized (Sect. 13(a)); 2. Minor children of non-Philippine citizens re- siding in the Philippine Islands at the time of their parents' natur- alization (Sec. 13(b)); 3. Children of naturalized persons born in the Philippine Islands subsequent to the parents' naturalization. It is apparent from the foregoing discussion that place of birth does not enter into a determination of Philippine citizenship except in the case of children of naturalized persons. Further, prior to res- pondent's deportation on June 8, 1936, as a British Subject to the Philippine Islands (Ex. 5), it was decided in the matter of Philip M. Paps on Habeas Corpus proceedings in the District Court of the United States in and for the Southern District of California, Central Division, No. 12767-M that Philippine citizenship does not extend to those persons born in the Philippine Islands to non-Philippine citizen parents, and that therefore the respondent had no claim to Philippine citizenship (Central Office No. 55894/502). Since that decision, the only change in the respondent's situation is that he states he now has determined that his father was never a British Subject. It would appear that he may be a citizen of Greece, the country of his father's birth, since, to his knowledge, his father never acquired any other citizenship. Respondent testified he last entered the United States in June, 1942, at San Ysidro, California. He was coming to the United States to remain permanently and did not have an immigration visa. Respondent testified that at the time of his last entry he was inspected by an immigration officer who asked him where he was born. He stated that he replied, "Philippine Islands" and that on being asked whether or not he was a citizen he said, "Yes", meaning that he was a citizen of the Philippine Islands. Respondent at the time of his last entry did not present a passport or other official document in the nature of a passport showing his origin and identity (pp. 6, 7). Respondent testi- fied he first entered the United States November 5, 1928, on the SS Dryden which first arrived in Honolulu and then in New Orleans, Louisiana (p. 7). Exhibit 3 is a Certificate of Seaman's Service, De- partment of Commerce, dated May 18, 1943, at New Orleans, Louisiana, showing Philip Paps discharged from the SS Dryden November 5, 1928. Respondent testified he remained in the United States until he was deported in 1936 (p. 8). Exhibit 5 is Form 535, Description of Person Deported, showing deportation of Philip Michael Paps on the SS President Coolidge from Sen Pedro, California, June 8, 1936. Exhibit 6 is a copy of Warrant of Deportation of Alien in the name of Philip Michael Paps, dated March 4, 1936, showing entry at New Orleans, Louisiana, on the SS Dryden, November 5, 1928. Respondent testified he next entered the United States in April or May of 1937, at Detroit, Michigan, at which time be did not have an immigration visa. He stated that he told the Inspector who inspected him that he was a citizen of the Philippines and that he was going to live in Detroit, Michigan. Respondent testi- 3 -
