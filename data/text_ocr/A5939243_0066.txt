A Yes, I would like to present affidavits from my sister and my brother in regard to their termination of my previous marriage. a Do you stipulate that these affidavits when received may be attached to the record as evidence and marked EXHIBITS 26 and 27 without the necessity of re- opening the case or your being present? A Yes. Q Do you have any other reasons to offer why you should not be deported from the United States? A I don't want to be deported. It's always been the ambition of my life to become an American citizen. PRESIDING INSPECTOR TO COUNSEL: Do you wish to question the respondent further? COUNSEL TO RESPONDENT: Q You also showed your degire to become a citizen by serving in branches of the armed forces--is that right? A Yes.
