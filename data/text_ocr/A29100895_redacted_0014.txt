Screened by NARA, 9/20/2022 YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT YOU ARE H.I.V. ANTIBODY NEGATIVE That means that you have probably not been infected with HIV (Human Immounodeficiency Virus). Still, you might want more information. The following questions and answers tell you, in simple language, what is known about the antibody test and about HIV, and how to protect your health and the health of others. For the most complete and up-to-date information, phone the AIDS Hotline: 1-718-485-8111. WHAT IS THE MEANING OF A NEGATIVE RESULT ON THE HIV ANTIBODY TEST? If, before you got the test, you waited six months since the last time you might have become infected with HIV, a negative result indicates that you are not infected with the virus. WHAT DOES A NEGATIVE TEST NOT MEAN? A negative test result is not a guarantee that you will not be infected in the future. Also, if you engaged in high-risk behavior within six months of taking the test (by taking in semen or vaginal fluid from an infected person, or sharing I.V. drug "works," such as needles) your test result might not be reliable. If that is the case, you may want to be retested at a later time. For an accurate result you must wait six months from the last time you might possibly have been exposed to HIV. Again, a negative result does not mean that you are protected from getting the virus in the future. It depends on what you do from now on. WHAT CAN I DO TO PROTECT MYSELF FROM HIV INFECTION IN THE FUTURE? - Use rubbers (condoms) whenever you have sex (anal, vaginal or oral) if your partner might be infected with HIV. The virus is found in semen. Rubbers can stop the virus from passing from one person to another. - Don't share I.V. drug "works," such as needles, syringes, plungers, cookers, water and cotton. Even very little blood left in the works can contain the virus. "The best protection is no injection." If you shoot up, get help to stop. WHAT TESTS WERE RUN ON MY BLOOD SAMPLE? Whether you got the test through a clinic, or through a New York City facility or testing site, the procedures are similar. Your blood sample was analyzed in a laboratory using a test called ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Your ELISA test was negative. -continued- CAT. # AI037
