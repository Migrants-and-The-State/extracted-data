Final action has been taken as follows: 1. Form ES-575 has been certified and is enclosed with the supporting documents. All en- closures should be submitted to the Immigration and Naturalization Service District Office either with your petition (Form I-140) or for consideration of alien's application for adjustment of status. 2. Form ES-575 has been certified and forwarded to the Kingston Consulate at which the alien has indicated he will file a visa application. The Consular Officer will inform the alien of the additional documents to be submitted and steps to be taken in order to apply for an immigrant visa. 3. On the basis of information available to us, we cannot issue the certification required by Section 212 (a) (14) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.
