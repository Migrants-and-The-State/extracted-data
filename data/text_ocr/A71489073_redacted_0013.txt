Screened by NARA, 9/28/2022 NEW 92 022 00310 A 71 489 073 success This petition, filed on July 23, 1992, seeks to classify the beneficiary as the parent of a United States citizen under section 201(b of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Title 8, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 204.2(c) states: (5) Petition in behalf of a parent. If a petition is submitted in behalf of a mother, the petitioner's birth certificate showing the name of the mother must accompany the petition. If a petition is submitted in behalf of a father or stepparent, the petitioner's birth certificate and the marriage certificate of his/her parent and stepparent must accompany the petition, as well as proof of the legal termination of their prior marriages, if any. It was concluded in the Matter of Richard, 18 I. & N. Dec. 208 (BIA 1982), that when foreign documents are relied on to establish the claimed relationship, this Service must be satisfied with the authenticity of these documents. In recent years the Service has identified a substantial number of fraudulent documents submitted in support of relative petitions which were purportedly issued by various civil authorities in Haiti. Therefore, the Service frequently requests the submission of supporting documents which are extracts from the National Archives, issued subsequent to July 12, 1983. The authenticity of these documents can be more easily verified. The National Archives of Haiti is the sole official repository of national records in Haiti. In support of this petition, you have submitted a translation of a civily recorded Hatian birth certificate. Because the authenticity of the documents submitted cannot be determined, the evidence fails to establish that the beneficiary is your parent. Therefore, the beneficiary cannot be classified as your parent for Immigration purposes. Also, we requested an appropriately recorded marriage certificate for FOIA b)(6) FOIA (b)(6) FOIA(b)(6) documenting name change from FOIA (b)(6) FOIA (b)(6) to To date this document has not been submitted. Section 201 (b) of the Act states in pertinent part: the term "immediate relatives" means the children, spouses, and parents of a citizen of the United States, except that, in the case of parents, such citizens shall be at least 21 years of age. The Service's records available at this time do not establish that you are a citizen of the United States. On October 19, 1992, you were requested to submit evidence that you are a citizen of the United States. The record does not include such evidence. Therefore, you have failed to establish that you are eligible to bestow the benefit sought for the beneficiary. In visa petition proceedings, the petitioner bears the burden of establishing eligibility for the benefits sought. See Matter of Brantigan, 11 I. & N. Dec. 493 (BIA 1966). In view of the above, the petition is denied. Attachment to Form I-797 Page 1
