23168/10-1 et al. - REPORT -- 3/27/24. BY THE CHAIRMAN: These applicants are seeking admission as the wife, son and daughter of Gee Park, alias Gee Lip Ong, an alleged native, whose status was conceded by this office when he was granted a favorable endorsement on his application, Form 430, Ma April 5, 1913. The alleged husband and father claims to have been born in san Francisco, and his file #16243/6-29 shows him to have made one trip to China, departing from this port, August 25, 1915, and returning on the "Siberia Maru", June 7, 1917. This trip made possible the paternity of the two applicants, Gee Fat and Gee Hai. On his return from that trip he claim to have been married to Yuen Shee, and claimed a son of the name and age of applicant 9-10. The applicant 9-11 was born after the alleged father's return to this country. There is in the :file of applicant 10-1, Yuen Shee, a certificate of the Medical Examiner of this Station to the effect that this applicant is affected with uncinariasis which may affect her ability to earn a living. She is therefore, inadmissble under the Immigration Law This board has today examined the alleged father and identifying witness, and applicant 10-1, the other applicantsbeing too young to testify. All testimony is in good agreement, and I am convinced the applicants have reasonably established their claimed relationship to Gee Park, - alias Gee Lip Ong, a citizen of the United States, and I move they be admitted as the wife, son and daughter respectively of a citizen. By Inspector Wessling: I second the motion. By Member Allen: I concur.
